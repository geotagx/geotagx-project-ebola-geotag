Here you can try to geotag images from the <a href="http://geotagx.org/app/ebola/">Ebola</a> module. Please test that module before this one.
<br><br>
This module is part of the <a href="http://citizencyberlab.eu">Citizen Cyberlab project researching citizen science</a>. It aims to raise awareness of Ebola emergency response efforts and to experiment with using GeoTag-X to support training about personal protective equipment. Results are experimental and do not directly contribute to Ebola response action. <b>The UN has created the first-ever UN emergency health mission for this crisis that includes <a href="http://www.un.org/ebolaresponse/needs.shtml">a list of what is still needed</a>. If you can contribute to emergency needs listed by UNMEER, please focus your efforts there first. </b>
<br><br>
If you have time to contribute to our research by completing this module, please share your feedback preferably <a href="https://github.com/geotagx/pybossa/issues">on GitHub</a>, or <a href="https://etherpad.mozilla.org/geotagx"> on Etherpad without logging in</a>.
