In this project, you can try to geotag images from the [Ebola project](http://geotagx.org/project/ebola/). Please try that project before this one because it contains more information about the outbreak.

Local knowledge of the region is valuable for geotagging photos in this project.

The Ebola outbreak map image icon comes from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ebola_Outbreak_Map.png).

Developed by Cobi Smith in association with the [UNITAR-UNOSAT Ebola response](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2014/11/unosat-joins-fight-against-ebola).
